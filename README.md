# Robotic-Printer-Assistant

Problem Statement:
We have a pile of papers printed by the printers at the UB printing sites placed in a bin (letâ€™s call it the bin 0). Each front paper is printed exactly identical to the one shown in the image below excepting the UBIT name which changes based on who ordered the print job.
